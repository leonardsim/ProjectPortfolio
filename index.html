            The portfolio will contain my personal reflection on the project that Declan and I have been working on throghout this year.
            We have been working in the Assistive-Tech group and collaborated together to do the Sound-Switch project.
          </p>

          <p>
            I will also include several code snippets which I have found quite interesting
            while working on the recording side of the project.

            <h1>Personal Reflection</h1>
          </div>
          <p>
            I would like to begin this by saying that working on this project was a pleasure and I have garnered a great deal of experience through
            learning how to use different tools, libraries and learning/working with a different language (Python), as well as, learning how the AGILE
            methodology (SCRUM meeting and such) was put to practical use. To start, when we first got assigned to do the Sound-Switch, both Declan and I
            had no prior knowledge on how to work with audio in programming. Our very first task was to find a library
            that could compare audio samples which then returns an accuracy of the audio comparison to see how similar they were; this proved to be quite
            challenging for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finding libraries wasn't the problem, but getting it to work was. Declan and I took turns in trying to get several libraries to run on our seperate systems
            ,but always ended up failing, due to dependency issues. This has caused us to be greatly demoralized and put off by the project initially, because
            every time we fixed a problem with the dependency issues, several more came and it felt like we were hitting against a wall everytime
            after breaking through. In the end, we managed to get a library (<a href="https://github.com/openpreserve/scape-xcorrsound">XcorrSound</a>)
            to work on a Linux OS. From here, we were split in tasks - Declan worked on the porting of the XcorrSound library to Windows OS, while I was tasked
            to build a recording/listening program.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, I was able to build a recording program in Python, but had to scrap it later, because it wouldn't play well with Declan's
            GUI which was done in C#. So I had to start from scratch and build a recording program in C#. Basically, I needed to have the mic listen to the background noise and if there is a sound that exceeds a certain pre-set threshold
            then it would start recording for a few seconds, but due to the lack of existing ones that will do this specific type of recording, I had to build my own.
            The process of building this was frustrating as I was unfamiliar with working with the (<a href="https://naudio.codeplex.com/">NAudio library</a>), which was core
            for recording, but in the end it was extemely rewarding when it was working as intended.
          </p>
          <p>
            From here, we were able to speed things up significantly and both of us were able to deliver a working prototype by the end. Both Declan and I spent the
            rest of the semester polishing up the program. In conclusion, what started slow and unmotivating, turned out to be quite enjoyable and very educational.
            Declan and I have worked really hard in getting the Sound-Switch to work. If I had one thing  I could do differently, is that I would've wished I tried to put more
            time into this project during the first semester

            <h1>Interesting Code Snippets</h1>
          </div>
          <h4>Microphone Listening Feature</h3>
          <p>
            The code below shows how I've implemented the listening and recording feature for the program. Basically, the microphone will pick up noises and
            my method will calculate the Root-Mean Square of the sound level and display it. Because this sourceListening_DataAvailable method is an Event Delegate
            type that will be added to the Wave In Event Handler. Since it is constantly checking the microphone feed, I had to implement a recordedFlag property
            so that it will only write to a wav file once the recordedFlag property is set to true and this only happens when the microphone detects a sound that exceeds
            a pre-set threshold by the user. Once it cycles to the next event, the flag will now be true and will start writing the sound to a wave file for 1 second.
            After it has recorded for 1 second, the wavefile will be disposed; clearing the memory and finalizing the wave file.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wouldn't have been able to get this part working properly if I didn't request for help in the NAudio forum. Inititally, my code did not have the flags there,
            so it was just an if-else statement with the if condition being the threshold and the else being the write-to-wave method. This caused issues, as it
            wouldn't properly record, since it only writes the first byte of the sound of that event cycle, and never drops to the else in the next cycle to record
            for 1 second. Setting up the flags and splitting the threshold detection with the write-to-wave method eliminated that problem.
